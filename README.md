### IMPROVED STYLING WITH CSS
# Pinpoint E-Commerce
In this project, you will use the knowledge you gained within the Color for UI lesson and apply it to an e-commerce checkout page. You will take an existing grayscale website and apply colors to various elements and sections within the design to ensure users understand the error and active states as well as primary calls-to-action.

This means you will need to consider which elements need to be updated based on providing the user with enough information to continue adding their information to complete their checkout process.

Remember, it’s important to use colors that will help them make the right decisions and provide feedback they can adequately act on.

Please note the workspace example on the right is built to fit into the viewing area. If you increase and decrease the viewable area of the web site, the site will update and respond to the viewport’s dimensions.
